## Hi there I'm Jorge Arteaga👋
I'm currently working on a Internet and Web Development Bachelor of Applied Science degree at Arizona State University.

I am working as a Graphic Designer in higher education and would like to expand my skill set to include web development, so I may have more knowledge and control of how my visual contributions are applied through web content.

Fun fact: I drove up the PCH in one of these and had a blast!
